# Tree-species-classification-using-CNN


This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The process includes several steps such as loading images, preprocessing, defining the CNN model, compiling and fitting the model, and calculating the accuracy. It's important to note that in this example, the dataset is only divided into training and testing sets, and only the test accuracy is printed in the results.

## Step 1: Loading Images

We first load the images from the dataset. This step involves importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset into memory.

```python
import numpy as np
